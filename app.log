        # Handle different user inputs and provide appropriate responses

        print("Chatbot: " + chatbot_response)

        # Check for order completion or exit conditions
        if order_complete:
            break

chatbot()
```

Note: The above code is a basic starting point and does not include the complete implementation. You will need to fill in the missing parts based on your specific requirements and the OpenAI Completions API documentation.

Response: Day 1: Research and Planning
- Understand the requirements and constraints of the project.
- Research on OpenAI Completions API and GPT-4 turbo.
- Plan the architecture of the chatbot.
- Define the features and functionalities of the chatbot.
- Plan the user interface and user experience of the chatbot.

Day 2: Setting Up the Environment
- Set up the development environment.
- Install necessary libraries and dependencies.
- Get the API key from OpenAI.
- Test the API with some basic requests.

Day 3: Development - Part 1
- Start coding the basic structure of the chatbot.
- Implement the functionality to take orders.
- Implement the functionality to handle different types of pizzas and toppings.

Day 4: Development - Part 2
- Implement the functionality to handle delivery details.
- Implement the functionality to confirm orders.
- Implement error handling and validation checks.

Day 5: Testing and Deployment
- Test the chatbot thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
- Fix any bugs or issues found during testing.
- Deploy the chatbot.
- Document the project and write a user manual.

Starter Code:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

def ask_gpt3(question, chat_log=None):
    if chat_log is None:
        chat_log = start_chat_log
    response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-002",
      prompt=chat_log+question+'\n- OpenAI:',
      temperature=0.5,
      max_tokens=150
    )
    answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return answer

start_chat_log = '''You are a helpful assistant that takes pizza orders.'''

while True:
    question = input("You: ")
    answer = ask_gpt3(question, start_chat_log)
    print("AI: ", answer)
```

This is a basic code to start a conversation with the AI. You need to replace 'your-api-key' with your actual OpenAI API key. The function ask_gpt3 sends a message to the AI and gets its response. The conversation continues in a loop until you stop the program. You will need to add more code to handle pizza orders and delivery details.
